# Social nexus  
 
At first this project was supposed to be like SecureDrop, but I decided to pivot to a sort of social billboard web app. new name coming soon^TM

### Current routes

* **/**: the index. Has a link to the dropper and recipient pages

* **/dropper**: Where to make posts. Basically a form with a textbox right now

* **/recipient**: where to see all the posts

* **/delete/_id_**: api request thingy to delete the post with the corresponding id
